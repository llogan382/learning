# Stages of maturity

1. Stage 1. Version 1. You are digging into the brand, and discovering needs. Start of version 2 is the moment you release version 1.

2. Stage 2 is growing adoption. Iterate to make it easy to adopt. This is where you realize, there is a product, and users that need to be supported.

3. The transition to stage 3 is a mindset. It is when your focust shifts away from adoption. It is about understanding adoption. There are lots of users, and bugs surface. You have to prove it will have the impact it promised. Leadership will look for results here. Building an iterative product. Contribution, deprecation are here.

4. This is harder to define when it starts. It is when the system, and team are good leaders. Instead of a product, it is an org within the company. These teams are seen as people who have a voice in the work.


# Grass Roots vs Top Down.

Top Down is when executive leadership was involved in the beginning.

Grass roots is when exec leadership was not involved.

Top down: THere is more visibility, broad scope, high-pressure to deliver. Maybe there have been failures in the beginning?

Grass roots: There are a few people frustrated with their own process, and want to do it better. Sometimes it is done out of a passion, outside of hours. Scope is narrow: Fix your own issues.

Over time (in each stage listed above) the differences between grass-roots and top-down become less and less.
It is unhealthy to exist without buy=in from both leadership and individual contributors.

If you dont demo the value to the business, it is gone.

# What is the maturity?

What about input fields? There are so many nuanced ways it needs to be extended. How can you gracefully enforce what the designers have put forth?

This comes down to a cultural thing within the organization.

# Building Stage 1.

"Discovering the 'right' version 1"

Often, people just start, instead of picking WHERE to start. The mindset is, "start quickly, show value". And they shape to project to please the right people, the right stakeholders.

Instead, look at it this way:
Who has LOW INFLUENCE?
Who has HIGH INFLUENCE? DIANE
Who can help?
Who will hurt the project?

If you can identify the high-influence people who are against the project, it can help.

Who will be using the system? What are the groups that will be using it?

1. Product and feature: the website, anyone using an app.
2. Discipline driven groups: UI designers, UI devs, product owner
3. Discipline by product driven: UI designers on E commerce, UI decs on Checkout, UX designers on ios shopping app.

Then, see how those groups measure progress.
