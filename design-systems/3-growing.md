# Stage 2: growing adoption.

Forcing people is NOT the best way to do it, and have it last. Instead, create a system people want to use.

Do the work: listen to the subscribers, build something that solves their problems. Then, grow it to sho value. Who could be using it, but isnt?


Look at it this way: What systems are people using now, and what is successful? What could be changed?

Talk with people. See what they want. What is it that people actually need?
Changing workflows takes time, effort. It is hard to identify a percentage of adoption that indicates success.

THe thing that indicates success is the level of effort to onboard a single person as a new user. Over time, it is easier for everyone.

Basically, make it as easy as possible for users to come on board.

Ask someone, what does it take to become a new user? How does the experience move between excitement and frustration?

Often, it starts with excitement, then quickly moves to frustration, before going back to excitment. In stage 2, we are trying to minimize the frustration, to reduce the large onset of frustration.

Overall, manage their expectations.

# Define adoptable parts.

Create layers that can use just parts of it, like GUIDELINES for how to use colors.

For example: using the grid and spacing part of the design system, but not the color schemes. Or, using the system from 2 years ago. Is that considered adoption?

The solution: GIVE THE USERS A PATH TO FOLLOW to adopt. Give them Tiers of levels of adoption.

For example, the path to adoption could be something like:

1. Understand foundations.
2. Layout, type, and color
3. Use all parts of fundamental layers
4. Use all parts of components relevant to product.
5. Contribute feedback, documentation, content, UX, etc.


# Health Metrics

What are some things to measure for success? How can you mesaure adoption?

1. The version of the system?
2. Product coverage. How much of the produc is using the system?

The best way to get adoption is to build trust with users. Keep all items in sync. All assets, need to be in sync. How can you ensure an asset is updated in all the areas, like design and engineering?

Pick a single path, and a few ways to measure health.
