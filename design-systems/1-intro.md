# Anatomy of design system.

Every brand is trying to connect with an audience. Advertising, kiosks, websites, etc.

The design system sits between your BRAND and your people.

# Do I need a design system?

1. Scale. There is an ORGANIZATIONAL scale. A small size, where people have been there forever, ppl dont need it.

2. If you have many digital products, design system might be helpful.
3. Product and market, It takes time to get there. Do you have time (1 year plus?)

Lets look at the pieces.

# Foundations Layer

it is a subset of the organizations brand to be used in the design and dev of digital interfaces.

# Tokens layer.

Take the design concepts, and give them a value.
For instance, instead of color, say color=#bdaa55.  This provides a consistent experience.
If there is a change, this single source of truth makes it easy.
Once it is defined, it gets supported on many different platforms.
Things like spacing, borders, opacity, etc.

# Core systems.

This is a set o building blocks. If you codify spacing, you can do things like layout, etc.

Creating stability here is important.

# Components layer.
These are the buttons layouts, etc. And the header, navigation.
These are built on the layers listed above.
Things like notifications, search bars, text inputs.

Each Layer has 3 parts:

# Assets.

Design files. Font files. UI/UX design files.

So, for color:
Foundations Layer: Logo Files.
TOKENS layer: Css token value.
CORE SYSTEMS: Sass layout system.
COMPONENTS LAYER: creating the button in figma.


# Processes

Things like:
communication
governanace and testing
contribution
Synchronization
Deprecation. If there is a better way to do something.
Release and versioning.
Onboarding. How can pieces be extended to do something different?

Foundations layer: How to communicate between brand and design systems.
Tokens layer: What happens if a value needs to be changed?
Core systems: How to deprecate an old system?
Components: How to add, modify, extend.

As you start, none of these items are defined.

# Documentation:

Why something is the way it is. It answers the following:

What do we beleive about this?
Why do we believe this?
What is this thing?
How do I use or migrate to it?
When should I use, not use it?
Who oens it?
Where does it live?
Examples of it in use.

Foundations layer: Point of view on color.
Tokens layer: How to name a color.
Core systems: how to implement a core, theme systme.
Components: how to use it.

# Consistency and efficiency.

Take the time, create our own definition. One cannot make assumptions.
Teams dont realize the full benefits of a design system.

The LAYERS can be consistent.
Having foundations show that all levels of an org help make something work together. Each part is moving in the same direction.

Design starts with the brand, and moves out.

# Efficiency.

Assets allow an individual to build faster.
Processes allow us to move more quickly together.

Define the language to use to discuss things. Help people understand each other.
Miscommunication means we are all moving in different directions. At the root, it is because we havent taken time to define our language.

What is it, and why is it important?

In practice, you dont start at the foundation, and move out. You start with one piece, and refactor it into a more-usable way. It is a constant refactoring.

You cannot depend too much on leadership, and you cant depend too much on the users. You have to have buy-in from both parts.

The cost of communication is HIGH.
If you dont understand each other, each person will THINK they are on the same page, but they are not.

Teams that dont prioritize their own, but use an outside part.

This comes down to culture. But, outside parties, third parties work well in the beginning, but then they realize it wont do what they dont want it to do eventually.


What is important to the organization?
Speed, collaborating? Third parties.

Collaboration, teamwork: use their own.
