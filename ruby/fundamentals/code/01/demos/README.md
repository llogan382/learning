Thank you for watching "Ruby: The Big Picture"!

The ZIP file you downloaded contains:
  * This readme..
  * The `albums.csv` file and `classic_jazz.rb` program from Module 2 ("Discovering Ruby").
  * The `dispenser.rb` code from Module 3 ("Understanding Ruby Objects").

If you want to follow along and type commands in a terminal, you need a Ruby interpreter. Your easiest option is to Google for "ruby online interpreter" and open an interactive Ruby shell in your browser.

If you want to run programs from a file, then you might want to install Ruby locally. First, check that you don't already have it installed. Type this command in a terminal:

    ruby --version

If you don't have Ruby, then go download an installer from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.

Once you have Ruby installed and working in a terminal, run `irb`. It's the default Ruby shell. It's not as pretty as Pry (for example it doesn't have syntax coloring out of the box), but it does the job.

If you prefer to install Pry, the interpreter that I'm using in the videos, then run this command:

    gem install pry

That's all you need. Enjoy the training!
