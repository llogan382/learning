# Ruby ecosystem


1. The official Ruby. YERV- is the current version.
2. Rubygems and bundler. Called *rubygems*. So far, I used *pry*, which is a gem. Use the *gem* command to load all dependencies.
3. **Bundler**. Takes the dependencies and manages them.
4. Editor. Static langauges like IDE's, like VS Code. There is **RUBYMINE**
5. Community. Not as active as they once were.

# Pros and Cons

## Cons.
1. It is slow
2. Slow for High performance- like ML, or real time, or number-crunching
3. It is easy to mess up your own code.

## Pros

1. Good as general-purpose scripting language, especially ETL (extract, transform, load). Take data from somewhere, transform, and return somewhere else. Also, rails is great for web apps.
2. Rapid prototyping.
3. Powerful, with expressive syntax. Good for "programmer happiness"
