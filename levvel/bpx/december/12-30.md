# call w Jim

Soap 4 r.

Documentation is crap for it.
It only works w 1 wsdl

So he is left to webrick, which is only a dev server.
THere is somehting called Ruby Rack, where you write to a spec.

If I had to do it from scratch, I would do PUMA, where security is built in.
If we use that, we get the full SOAP payload.
Then, it is up to US to parse it (marshal it)

Auto generation
Soap4r- he couldnt get it working.
THere is a router- it references marshalling.

Either:
1) walk through the RUBY code.
2) do the stuff we know we can do.

## CAPO?
Jim wants to set up patterns for these.

Jim is going to keep using Ruby rack.
It uses a modular approach.
3 implementation for each service.

Jim: I dont always say what Im thinking

There is a suite of tests written for MC to pass these.
