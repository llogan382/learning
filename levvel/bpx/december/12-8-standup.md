Jim: We need Bharghav to be our advisor.

Mason: Get Luke in there, for client expectations.
Some cards do have data attributes. For now, we will ignore those.

Mason: 3-4 attributes related to card in spec, proxy processor. We need clarification.
We have been focused on SOAP/XML

We need to interact with JSON interface/format/responses.

7 SOAP services. And 3 rest endpoints to create.

Mason: Luke needs VPN, secrets.

Jim: We want a codebase that is stable with a good apttern. Can we just pick your brain?

## Jim shares his screen

What is difference between `bpx_client` and `bpx`? Client was created by Bharghav.

Jim: I created a new gem, and moved some of the classes BHARGHAV created.

Bh: use underscore for directories, not hyphens.

run `bundle install` with the new directory structure, after Jim changed all directory names.
