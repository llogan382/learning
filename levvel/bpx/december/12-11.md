# Daily standup

Chris: Today is my last day,

Luke: I did rspec, and app header.

Jim: Dont do more than 3 headers.
Today I will wrap up request object.
Mixins might make the Nokogiri patterns more useable- Jim will be doing work on those mixins.
I'd like to do an overview of loading patterns and architecture.
Use the `autoload` feature to make it more efficient please.
I am PTO today.

Bharghav: RTL_service

Also, another question.
For Business Application Header, Nokogiri does a great job of creating an XML document.

However, when working with a response (what I am doing now), nokogiri doesnt have any canned-methods for creating an object FROM xml.

There IS a method to create a HASH out of an XML document, but will that work with our current configuration?

Thoughts?
