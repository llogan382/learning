## Soap: What to do.

1. Jim has done `rtl_confirm_spec`.
2. I will do `req_for_pmt` because it is so big
3. Bhargav does `pmt_ref`

Here is the repo:
https://github.com/GetLevvel/bpx-server/

The goal is to createa  mock server response.

**What to do**
1. Run documentation. After `bundle_install` run `yard doc` then `yard server`. This will build documentation, and put it on a local server.
2. Look at the header class name in the documentation. In Jim's example. he is doing `rtl_confirm_spec` and clicked in the documentation for the method `RtlConfirmationMethods`. This was found on my server here: (http://localhost:8808/docs/BpxServer/RtlConfirm/RtlConfirmationMethods)[http://localhost:8808/docs/BpxServer/RtlConfirm/RtlConfirmationMethods]

**Find debugging to see whats happening**
3. Set a breakpoint in the `service_impl.rb` file.
4. In the spec, rub `debug` and a list of all the embedded ruby objects will show. Let's look at the `appHeader` (line 48) in `service_impl.rb`. We want to build the JSON request to send to Payrailz.
