## BPX Server

For bpx server:

1. It receives an inbound xml string.
2. It marshals that XML string to JSON.
3. It sends that JSON string to the BPX clien server (PR), and gets a JSON response.
4. It converts the JSON response to XML string.


What to do:

1. In the responses, fill in the data. Hit the server, and see what we get back. We can do LL Retrieval, and thats about it. `responses.rb`
