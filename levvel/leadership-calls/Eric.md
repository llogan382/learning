# Eric

Ideas in the meantime:

Benchtime!
There are a few categories:
1. Gaining knowledge, ramping up.
2. Great opportunity for professional dev. THere are a whole list of items to fill in here.
3. Eric is working with Alicia- she coordinates people and projects, and is working to streamline this.
4. Manage internal tools- things like fixing our own website with whoever is on the bench.

5. Eric wants us to be better at launching- speeding up the initial steps for launch. Called "accelerators".

The levvel CLI = Ian duckworth is in charge of it. Eric has a list of about 12 things he wants to do.

Financially we are in a good spot.
