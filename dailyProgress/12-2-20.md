# Yesterday I learned:

In REACT:
1. What is JSX? Just a way to do JS in the browser
2. It works like a STAMP- can be reused
3. **HOOKS** never go in loops. They keep track of STATE
4. `useEffect` takes place of some lifecycle methods (this is NEW)
5. Dev tools, and ASYNC

In DIGGING INTO NODE:
1. It runs on POSIX: with I/O/Error
2. Add HELP output while adding code
3. items are added as variables through the command line
4. minimist helps to create default TYPES for input- like boolean, number, etc.
5. In the header, add two items:
   1. `#!/usr/bin/env node`
   2. `"use strict"`
