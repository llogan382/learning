    <p><span><span><strong>TEKsystems Global Services,LLC </strong>("TEKsystems") conditionally offers to employ you Luke D Logan in
                the capacity of Developer commencing on 05/16/2022 at its client, APPLE INC ("Client") for
                services with the latter for a temporary period, to perform such duties and for such hours of work as may be
                assigned to you during the term of service (the "Assignment").</span></span></p>
    <p><span><span><strong>1. <u>Ratification</u></strong> – You understand and acknowledge that this offer of temporary
                employment with TEKsystems is subject to final approval by the Client and that you shall not be entitled to
                any wages or employment unless actually hired by TEKsystems to work the specific Assignment for the Client
                pursuant to this agreement and attached Appendix (collectively the “Agreement”). &nbsp;You also understand that this Agreement does not go into
                effect until you actually work on said specific Assignment. You acknowledge and understand that your
                employment with TEKsystems is “at will”, with no certain term being offered or promised, and that you or
                TEKsystems may terminate your employment, with or without cause, at any time.&nbsp; You agree that by
                reporting or remaining at work after signing this Agreement that you have ratified same. In addition, you
                represent and warrant to TEKsystems that your employment with TEKsystems will not violate the terms or
                conditions of any other agreement to which you are a party.</span></span></p>
    <p><span><span><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong><u>Scope of Employment with TEKsystems</u></strong> – You understand
                that your employment with TEKsystems will be co-extensive with the Assignment.&nbsp; In other words, your
                employment with TEKsystems begins when you first begin work for the Client on the Assignment, and ends if
                and when the Assignment is ended by the Client or otherwise.&nbsp; Following the end of the Assignment,
                while you may remain eligible for future assignments with other TEKsystems clients, you will not be employed
                with TEKsystems unless and until you are re-hired and assigned to another client.&nbsp; You further
                understand that following the ending of the Assignment, while you may remain eligible for new assignments
                with other TEKsystems clients, TEKsystems has no obligation to find you additional assignments and has no
                ability to compel any client to hire you.</span></span></p>

                a.m. on Monday of each week completed time records, approved and verified by a Client supervisor, indicating
                the number of hours worked.&nbsp; Failure to submit approved hours by 10:00 a.m. on Monday could result in a
                delay of the accurate amount of wages being paid. &nbsp;You acknowledge that TEKsystems needs completed time records to obtain
                payment from the Client, and therefore you will accurately complete, sign and assist TEKsystems in gaining
                Client’s approval and verification of your time records each week.&nbsp; You understand and agree that in
                the absence of complete and accurate time records, TEKsystems cannot accurately determine the number of
                hours worked and your corresponding wages. &nbsp;You acknowledge TEKsystems’ policy and practice of
                mandating recordation of all hours worked including recording compensable hours worked for time spent
                traveling.&nbsp; TEKsystems does not permit “off the clock” work or any similar practice of not recording
                hours worked.&nbsp; Any requests by the Client or other third party not to record all hours worked must be
                reported in writing by you to TEKsystems.</span></span></p>

                offer sick leave, your eligibility and ability to earn, accrue, and use paid sick leave is governed by the
                applicable law of that jurisdiction, and you will receive additional information regarding the applicable
                sick leave policy.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
    <div><br><span><span><strong>6. <u>Restrictive Covenant</u></strong> - In consideration of the terms of employment and

                specific written authorization has been obtained from TEKsystems.&nbsp; You agree that any violation of this
                provision will result in you paying to TEKsystems an amount equal to four hundred (400) hours at the hourly
                rate as stated in 4(a) above as compensation for TEKsystems’ efforts and costs incurred in connection with
                your employment hereunder.</span></span></div>
    <div><br><span><span><strong>7. <u>Confidentiality</u></strong> - You agree not to disclose to anyone, either during
                or after your employment with TEKsystems, any confidential or proprietary information of any kind obtained

                kind.&nbsp; You also agree to execute any forms or documents required by Client with respect to the
                foregoing.</span></span></div>
    <div><br><span><span><strong>8. <u>Information Security Matters</u></strong> - With respect to any equipment
                (“Equipment”) used by you in connection with your employment with TEKsystems, you agree to use the Equipment
                at all times in accordance with the applicable Information-Security Policies of TEKsystems’ customer to
                which you are assigned, as well as any applicable TEKsystems’ Information Security Policies.&nbsp; In the
                event there is a conflict between those policies, you shall follow that policy that bests ensures the
                protection and safekeeping of the Equipment and data contained on the Equipment.&nbsp; In addition,
                generally with regard to applicable Information Security practices, unless otherwise directed by TEKsystems’
                customers, you agree:&nbsp; (1) not to store locally on the Equipment any confidential or otherwise
                sensitive data, including, but not limited to, Protected Health Information, Personally Identifiable

                source;&nbsp; (2) to ensure constant control over the Equipment to prevent any opportunity for unauthorized
                use, including adopting a "Stand up, Lock up" practice of locking the Equipment when stepping

In the event you fail to comply with this section of the Addendum, you agree to indemnify TEKsystems for
                any and all claims, matters, suit or other liabilities that arise directly or indirectly as a result of your
                breach of this paragraph. Finally, in addition to you completing the TEKsystems Information Security
                Training at the beginning of your first assignment with TEKsystems, if 12 months have passed since you
                initially took the TEKsystems Information Security Training, you agree as a condition of employment, to take
                at that time the TEKsystems Information Training being offered and at the rate of pay as set forth in

                related injuries which might be sustained by me are covered by state workers’ compensation statutes, and to
