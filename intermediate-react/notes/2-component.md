# Spread operator

Dont use it much in a child component- It looks short and sweet, but we do not know the shape of the items being returned in that spread operator.

ALWAYS OPT FOR CODE THAT IS EASIER TO READ, than short and easier to write.


## What is react?

Pulling out the props, and putting them in the right locations.


## Strict mode.

It throws more errors. It comes from the react core team.
