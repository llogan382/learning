# Where do you keep your notes?

Hi, I'm Luke. A frontend developer, and I am interested in all sorts of things.

This is where I keep my notes about the things that I am **learning**, so that they can be available on various different machines, no matter where I am.

This year, in 2022, my goals are to learn about:

1. React State
2. Redux
3. XState
4. Advanced Typescript
5. Backend- Amplify on AWS
6. Prepare for an AWS certificate
7. Production grade react patterns.

Thanks for checking out my repo! Feel free to use any notes here that you find useful!
