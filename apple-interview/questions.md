1. A time when you struggled with something.

Greatest strength?

- being focused. Setting goals, accomplishing them.

Describe a time when you failed.

- migrating DB without a backup.

Biggest weakness?

- going too fast.

My goals?

- Architecture, and devops

What would you do in this situation?

- ask them as many clarifyng questions as possible.

Why should we hire you?

- You shouldnt. I dont know swift. Im not a CS major. I am not an asshole. I dont know backend super well. Last year at this time my phone was a google pixel. And my family will always be more important. But if you can look beyond that, I work my ass off. And I am curious. And after 6 years, I am still immensely motivated to learn as much as I can.

Pressure?

- Working out, balance in life.

Why apple?

- I am not the smartest one in the room, so I like to surround myself with a smart team. Apple has that.
- I want to learn about how apple integrates their ecosystem so well.

Tell me about yourself?

- Dev for almost 6 years now
- Saw career coach
- Wake up early.


Apple Pay/Apple Wallet experiences:

- at airport, paying was cool.


Questions for him:

- Why apple? Why has he stayed so long?
- Goals for the team?
- Why my resume?

Brian and Karl Fotovat

Have you been out here?
I have a long history at apple. This team: 2.5 years. 
Cant hire out west. 
SD, NY, Austin, London, Shanghai. 

Our team: We work in "Wallet payments commerce" WPMC
Everything inside the wallet. 
Production engineering. This is new. Strated last year. 

"Manager, Wallet & Payments SRE, Tooling & Telemetry Team at Apple"

Intended to bridge gap SRE (site reliabillity) and infra engineers. 
Our role, tools: portals, automation. 

We got this position: Tool built by our team, no longer here. Both are leaving apple. (Christian)

Dockhub- gatsby, mermaid. 
Gatsby version is old. 
Gatsby incremental builds0 GH hook, clones, builds it. These time out after 8 hrs. It is jenkins. 
We need to get this thing up to speed. 

Will incremental builds work?

Karl- PM, helping out on the project. 
Currently, it is un-maintainable. What is the best way to do that?

the MSD- Use dockhub and its capabilities to build MSDs into this portal. 

Gatsby vs. Nextjs?

Static, keep certain parts hidden. 
Build times- 

Integrations- not many. Auth? Aplle connect. 
Docs- are all in repos. They can add things to the config. 

Protect docs. 
"bundle" is used on a partner site. Those teams have taken the project, they gave it back. 

Docs in yaml, md

We habe ppl who own repos. This will look for changes, and as changes are pushed, it will push them into a tree to watch. 

Can we fix the 500 error. 

Jenkins- called "rio" internally. Templates and configs. Optimizing this is a focus. 
Other cloud stuff- could also be improved. 
Jenkins- used widely? 
Answer: there are portals, many are using this system. It is not likely customer facing. 

Each deployment is an independent deployment. Anything else in Rio is not depending on it. 

Any project has a jenkins pipeline and a rio pipeline. 

It is performing well on other builds. Deployment pods, kubernates, are the bigger problem. 

"I am excited for you to come on board".

You have enthusiasm for talking about these build tools. 

Many customer facing projects- 

This kicks off the deploy as well. 

We will figure out some devs for you to talk to. And figure out the next steps. 

Current bldg cary: 

There are 3 people in that office. No seats right now. 

Timeframe: Talk w those guys next week. Project is ready to get going. Dont know how long the project would last.
