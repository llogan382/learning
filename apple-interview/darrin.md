## Call with Darrin

1. What was your timeline
Wallets, Payment and Commerce- QA, automation, etc.
Joined in May, 2020. Before hand, he was at Charles Schwab. Was at Paypal.


2. Benefits at apple- I read something about $55k in stocks for ICT3, is it true from your experience?
   People in other cities are paid 14% more. Converting to FTE: Apple asked salary.
   Initial stock when you join- stock employee program. You can put 10% of gross pay into that. Initial grant- under 1700 shares (277100). 4 years vested. In his review, 500 more shares. You always have some stock that is vesting.

3. Tell me about going in to the office. Is that up to manager or apple corporate?
   Transitioning back to office 3 days a week. It has come down company wide. This is the 3rd or 4th time.
   We have to self=test, and must have a negative within 3 days.
   They want people 3 days a week. Corporate thinks that will help.
   Apple Corporate wants to reclaim that corporate identity of working in person.
   They are allowing managers some flexibility. The flex will diminish.
   There is some flexibility.
   It could be hammered out with the manager.
   While contractor, little pressure to be in-person.

5. When you were a contractor, how many contractors were on your team?
   4 or so?
6. What percent of contractors would you say convert?
   It is a high percentage.
7. What happened to contractors that didnt convert?
8. Work life balance?
   I am motivated about work/life balance than anywhere else I have ever worked.
   Family is first.
   "We want to arrange things so everything works for people LONG TERM".


I have seen several people go through being contractors.
After 4 months, would you interview?
Longest tenured- he converted before.
The team is growing a lot.
Another girl started right after, but she wasnt sure.
Another contractor- he started after Darrin. They made an offer, but he left. The team is 4 FTE, 2 contractors, and working on converting that person.
