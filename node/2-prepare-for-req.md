## What happens?

1. The JS function is stored in memory.


`const server = http.createServer(doOnIncoming)
server.listen(80)`

What is happening here?
we are DEFINING A CONTSTANT;

2. Take the function, and store it to be auto-run in C++

The computer's internal features (like networking).

So we are writing the above code in JS, and NODE/C++ take the function, and tell the computer's internal features what to do (listen on port 80)
