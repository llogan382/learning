# From Front End Masters API Design in Node v3

[Repo for the course](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/api-design-node-v3)


What is an API?

tldr: A server that creates an HTTP interface for interacting with some data.

API determines HOW you can interact with the DATA:

CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

APIs got popular when SaaS products started offering APIs for integrations

RUBY made it SUPER popular.

Works well with BASIC data models.

It is hard to scale with COMPLEX data models and client requirements.

Node is Async and Event driven.
It is single-threaded.
