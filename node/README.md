# IDEAS/Things to Learn

[Course Progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XQOJsh5Z3P6kny5fViFxQFulGP8fW3Xgq-nw7poDNZc/edit#gid=0)


Goal:

Learn NODE.
What is it, what does it do?

- Node is the JS server side language. It works with C or C++ to access files.
- It works with the Network and PORTS on the computer
- It uses EXPRESS for server stuff (among others)
- CONTROLLERS return something
- MIDDLEWARE will do something BEFORE returning data to the browser.
- It handles CRUD operations
- it can run a server
- It can interact with a database
- It can handle Authentication
- It can build APIs
- Handles GET/PUT/POST/DELETE methods
- It always takes in the info as a REQUEST, DOES SOMETHING WITH IT, and RETURNS IS (as a RESPONSE)
- It is single threaded. THere are no loops. But there is a lot of Async/await
- regardless of the DB, all I have to do is change models and controllers



How can it be implemented (tools)?
- It can use MongoDB as a server (among others)
- It can use MONGOOSE to create MODELS out of SCHEMAS (among other tools)
- JSON web token auth
- GRAPHQL
- EXPRESS
- HAPI


Build somethign with it.

- Build a TIMER app.

Concepts I need practice with:

- [ ] Async Await. This is included in other courses
