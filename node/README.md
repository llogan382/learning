# From this course

[Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/course-overview/)

Node is built on Chrome's V8 JS Engine.
Created back in 2009

The node community is so large. Resources are so vast that there is help no matter what you are building, it has likely already been built before.

Node doesnt hook into a DB by itself (unlike Ruby). However, the node community likely does have a tool that is similar to node.

Rumor: Node is not the best for data-intensive operations.THIS IS TRUE.
It is not meant for high, cpu-intensive operations. That is just the nature of Javascript, single threaded with an event loop.
