# Browser vs. Node JS

Browser:
- It is visual.
- It has a DOM
- Window
- Fragmentation. Not all JS can be used in all browsers.
- optional modules (es6)
- Cannot access filesystem
- Async


Node:
- Not visual
- NO GUI. NO DOM. Anything you do with the DOM, cannot be done on the server.
- No window, but it does have a global.
- No fragmentation. Just version numbers.
- Required modules (commonjs +)
- Can access filesystem
- Async
- No browser based APIs.
