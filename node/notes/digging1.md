# Digging into Node.js by Kyle Simpson

This is from the [Front End Masters Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/digging-into-node/introduction/)

## The middle End
What is it that touches the frontend and the backend? Let's call that the **middle end**
The ME is just JSON that communicates between any of these things.

How can the same code be used in the FE and the BE?

The way NODE works are with THREADS- high I/O (input output) threads; Node is best suited for that.

Node's best story is that it can be inserted as the touchpont between the FE and the BE; it is a touch point between the devs on both sides, and the tasks are performed by NODE.
