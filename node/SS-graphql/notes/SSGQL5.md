# Resolvers

They can be done in QUERIES or in FIELDS.

If you want to resolve FIELDS

Query is just a TYPE.

All TYPES can have RESOLVERS.
PET can resolve its fields.

By default, GQL does create a resolver for every field. It looks for a key name, and resolves it.



## WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

As a dev, on the backend?
Make the TYPES, make the CONNECTIONS, and make the RESOLVERS.

Every field needs to be accounted for- by a RESOLVER I make, or a DEFAULT resolver.
