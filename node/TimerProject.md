From that sermon, the give and take of JUSTICE vs MERCY stood out to me.

Justice being what is deserved, and mercy being what we don't deserve.
The illustration of the prodigal son was on point.
The son wanted to come back in shame not deserving much (Justice), but the dad jumped at the chance to throw a party (mercy).
Showing mercy was showing love.

The other son did not show mercy- he thought only of JUSTICE.

I know its hard and its not fair, but this is what we are called to do: show MERCY to others, and not JUSTICE. After all, what if YOU got justice and not mercy? In the same way we receive mercy, we should show it to others.

I am not a preacher, and life is hard. It sounds like your heart is heavy, and that is understandable.
I could be wrong, but it sounds like you are looking to Evan as the thing that can turn it around. If that is true, that is a big burden to place on her, and she will fail. Everytime.

My prayer, is for Christ to keep growing in your heart, whatever that looks like. It replaces a heavy heart with joy. It will replace JUSTICE with MERCY.

If I am off base here, let me know. I do love you, and these are just the things that I hear.
