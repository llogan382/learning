## software modeling.


we are talking about how an app is supposed to behave at any given moment?

When a user is on a certain page, like a checkout, what should the user be able to do? Like, submitting payment before entering credit info.

What if we want more than a true/false boolean? Like, if it is saving to the cloud? In which case, it could be:
1. true
2. fasle
3. saving
