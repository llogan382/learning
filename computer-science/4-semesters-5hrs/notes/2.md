# Sorting Algorithms.
## 0:41

Bubble sort. Its not used in production code, but is useful for conceptualizing the idea.

This is when you take two numbers at a time, and compare them if they are out of order.

So, the outer loop will always run.
The inner loop will keep running if the numbers are out of order.

# Insertion Sort

You can ignore large parts of your array that are already processed.

You have an outer loop and an inner loop, but it ends up being way more efficient than bubble sort.

If index is 1, everything before 1 is sorted, everything after 1 in not sorted.
