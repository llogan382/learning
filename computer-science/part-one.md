*Merge sort.* Break it down into the smallest levels, then order them, and merge into a larger, sorted lists. Like, once an array is sorted until it is an empty array, it goes to the next array.


JENKINS

Maven Plugin.

Integrate with Github. Security. Automating the build, and publish results. Github should trigger a build.

Benefits of integrating:

1. clone codebase to local
2. GH pushes new changes.
3. Jenkins can do GH operations.

GH must be able to send data to Jenkins, so Jenkins must have a public IP.


Jenkins will send

*quick sort* IN JS, it usually uses merge sort. V8 sometimes uses quick sort, becase it is better on memory. For quick sort, a PIVOT is created, and items are put on the LEFT or RIGHT depending on whether it is greater or smaller than the pivot.

*binary search* It only works if the array is already sorted.

*Array List* These are bad for deletions, and adding things in the middle. What is the BIG O of this?

*Linked List* Everything is a NODE, and points to the next item in memory. This is hard for READ (think CRUD). For ADDING, it is wasy because you just change the POINTER. This is also easy to ADD THINGS in the middle, or DELETE things.
There is a LINKED LIST class, and NEXT() which takes a value.


*Graph* is  a tree without a root. It is like a tree, but doesnt have the same hierarchy as TREES. Like, a ROW in a database.
an EDGE connects two things: like for a social network, a FRIEND would be an EDGE.
A facebook friend is BI-DIRECTIONAL.
Twitter is UNI-Directional.
Internet of things: Also graphs. Also, AI, tensorflow. Mapping natural worls, mapping connection between two objects.
