# Patterns


This is exciting. It helps to create apps that can scale.

Patterns arent solutions. They are small sections: re usable units of knowledge.

Like software design patterns, these will help to optimize your DB.

- Use computed patterns to avoid repetitive computations
- structure fields with the attribute pattern
- handle changes with no downtime with schema versionining pattern

Well defined patterns will make the process more predicatable.


## Duplications.

Why? IT is usually the result of embedding info in a doc. It makes changing data a challenge when many docs need to be updated.
