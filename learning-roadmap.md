# June 2024 summary:

What do I know? What do I need to know?

First, let me start with what I know a lot of. Meaning, this is the basis, and I can speak on it, understand it, and read the code.

1. Javascript.
2. Typescript.
3. React.

What do I know a little of? Meaning, I can make sense of it, and find the answers if I needed to.

1. Docker
2. Nestjs
3. Nextjs.
4. Testing: Cypress, functional, testing libraries.
5. Node.js- Streams, FS
6. Vite.
7. Postgres
8. Software architecture patterns
9. Advanced GIT.
10. State management. react hooks.

What do I know very little of? Meaning, things around our team that I use, but am not responsible for/do not contribute to:

1. Postgres.
2. Networking.
3. CI/CD.
4. Authentication/permissions/access
5. Kubernetes
6. JS Runtimes/compilers
7. Other JS libraries, form libraries,
8. SOAP
9. Bash


What would be most useful for me to know?

1. React hooks.
2. Git.
3. Vite.
4. Software Architecture.


What do I spend time on?

Get all systems going.
Create a reservation.
Do a "happy path" test. Debug the logs to see if everything is running right.
Read all terminal logs.
So, automated testing could help.
What could I automate?

1. Automate a reservation. Postman?
    - Run API scripts to generate a reservation;
2. Understand reservations:
    - Lead
    - Contact
    - Reservation Alias.
    - How do these alias' work together?
3. Getting all systems to work together.
    - Combine them with something like Turbo?
    - Docker compose: All?
    - Concurrently

Then, get better at GIT.
Then, understand REACT HOOKS a bit better.
Then, create some CYPRESS TESTS or something.
Take a look at other tests and see how MEANINGFUL they are.
For testing:
    - Test for OOP.
    - Test for

1. For fms service: just check.
    - Create a script that can create a reservation.
        - Sends a request with a LEAD.
        - gets a response
        - Update reservation in DB
    - Create a script that tests some SE
    - Create a script that tests SL API calls.
2. For OMI:
    - update the reservation, widgetParams file for reservation.
    - Cypress to do the happy path.
