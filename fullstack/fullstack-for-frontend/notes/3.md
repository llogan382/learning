# Data centers and the cloud.
## 1:02

Servers are built in ways that computers are not. They have more CPUs. Multithreading.

When you run an app, it can fork commands. They are custom build to serve files.

They live in DATA CENTERS. They are clean (no dust) and highly secure. Like banks.

Every big app has its own data centers.

**Data centers are shared computers**

The cloud.
It can be in different parts of the world at the same time.

**Elastic computing** is scaling. So, the running servers can adjust with traffic.

bought an example server:

`https://cloud.digitalocean.com/projects/d245be5c-ded9-449b-a84c-d654a3d73838/resources?i=86767b`

For learning, digital ocean is the best.


# Operating Systems
## 1:15

There are basically two different types:
Unix and DOS

Linux and Windows.

Unix is not friendly, so there is a more friendly version called LINUX

There is a `kernel` which talks with the CPU. And there are `utilities`.
Everything is baked into the UTLITIES, that do just 1 thing a piece.

So, utilities can be changed without messing up the KERNEL

here is my hostname: `ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc3-01`

ip: `104.236.51.234`

then `ssh -i ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc3-01 root@104.236.51.234`

`exit` to exit the server

`#` means you are logged in as a super user. At ROOT, you can do a whole lot, including some damage.
